# WeGovNow OnToMap Logger - Joomla plugin #

This is the Joomla plugin which is implemented to allow any Joomla application to communicate with the WeGovNow OnToMap Logger.

It follows the “Dispatcher / Observer” design pattern in order to be able to “listen” specific events that are triggered by core application components (e.g. ImproveMyCity) and proceed with certain actions such as sending to the mapped concepts in the WeGovNow Ontology the corresponding metadata.
